An example of an HLR database might include the following subscriber information:

IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity): A unique identifier for the subscriber's SIM card.
MSISDN (Mobile Station International Subscriber Directory Number): A unique phone number assigned to the subscriber's device.
Authentication Key: A secret key used to authenticate the subscriber's identity and secure communication between the subscriber's device and the mobile network.
Subscription Profile: Information about the services the subscriber has subscribed to, such as voice, messaging, data, and roaming services.
Location Information: The current location of the subscriber's device, such as the serving network, cell site, and location area.
For example, the HLR database might contain a record for a subscriber with the following information:

IMSI: 123456789012345
MSISDN: +1-555-555-1234
Authentication Key: abcdef1234567890
Subscription Profile: voice and data services, no roaming
Location Information: currently located in network A, cell site 1234, location area 5678

This information allows the mobile network to efficiently manage the subscriber's services, authenticate their identity, route calls and messages to the correct location, and provide a personalized experience to the subscriber.
