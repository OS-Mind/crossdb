# Contributing to CrossDB

CrossDB OSS is free, open-source software. Its development is led by the CrossDB Team, but we welcome contributions from all community members and open-source developers. This document describes how you can contribute, no matter whether you're a user or a developer yourself.

## Bug reports

All users can report bugs to us through the **[GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/crossdb-org/crossdb/issues)**. To ensure that the development team can locate and resolve the issue that you experienced, please include the following in your bug report:

- A detailed description of the issue, including the steps to reproduce it.
- Any log files that may be relevant to the issue.

## Code contributions

Developers are encouraged to submit patches to the project, and all contributions, from minor documentation changes to bug fixes, are appreciated by our team. To ensure that your code can be merged successfully and improve the experience for other community members, we ask that you go through the following procedure before submitting a pull request: 

1. Read and accept the terms of the CrossDB Contributor License Agreement (CLA) located at [https://cla-assistant.io/crossdb-org/crossdb](https://cla-assistant.io/crossdb-org/crossdb).

2. For bug fixes, search the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/crossdb-org/crossdb/issues) to check whether the bug has already been filed.

   - If the bug that you want to fix does not exist in the issue tracker, click **New issue** and file a report.
   - Ensure that you note the issue number in your pull request when you submit your patch.
